YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO USE THIS SOFTWARE AT SCALE WITHOUT THE WRITTEN CONSENT OF JAMES GLADNEY.

This software is made public for the study and to serve as an example for development of large scale simulators.

*This software was developed and designed to help the Yu-Gi-Oh! Online community which for years has been socially suffering. In line with that, to protect the community this project is 'mostly open'. This software can not be used at scale without my written permission. That means no more than 10 users. There is a very speific use case I have in mind where I will not give out an a flexible licence if asked, by companies and major community leaders. I've seen this software abused I do not want to see that happen again. Basically you are not allowed to use this without asking its creators permission first.*
