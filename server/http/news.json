It is every single card from the Tag Force games and ONLY those. It will set the foundation for SD's anime set!</p><p>To access these cards, open your SD Launcher, wait for full updates, go to settings, database, and pick <strong>1-Anime</strong>. You'll immediately see the effect in your deck editor. Keep in mind many of these cards were made in a hurry and are likely to contain <strong>many</strong> bugs! We depend on you lovely users testing to be able to find them all. We will be opening a bug report thread right after this so let us know if anything isn't functioning correctly.</p><p> Above all, have fun and enjoy this new feature of the Salvation YGOPro Server! Many of our staff have been pushing for it for over one year now and we are very proud to announce that <strong>anime is here at Salvation.</strong></p><a href='http://forum.ygopro.us/index.php?/topic/17-first-batch-of-anime-cards-is-here/'>",
