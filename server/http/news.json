Watch this and you 'might' understand what is going on. </p><iframe width='560' height='315' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/PlagRkD4e8s' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe>'<p>So my IRL job is a that of a programmer and I really enjoy my job so much its a 'hobby' at home and I've built up Salvation to serve the public. But the overlay of 'what ygopro is' and what everyone else needs it to be is pretty big. YGOPro was not intented to be a working program. All variants are technically 3 years of alpha from the beta. So I've started to rewrite all but the Lua scripts and ygopro-core processor here are Salvation so the square peg might fit in the round hole. I love the community I always have but I want you all to know the staff here is very overworked and working ever harder each day. Special thanks to the staff and assistants here:<br /><br />-Vyro [Database Admin]<br>The SecretShadow [QA]<br>Adriano Soares[Software Engineer]<br>HelixReactor[Scriptor]<br>DragunLegend[QA]<br>WestCoastKiwi [Web Developer, QA Lead]<br>OneShot [Scriptor, Lead]<br>YGOHack137 [Scriptor, External]<br>ChibiChanNyan[Software Engineer, Database Admin Lead, Scriptor]<br>Irate[Software Engineer]<br>Freezy[Graphic Designer]<br>Tsudere[QA]<br>Tragedy[UI, Web Designer],<br>Stormwolf[Public Relations, QA, Database Admin]<br>Reach[Public Relations, Graphic Designer, Eng-Ops]<br>OmniMage[Software Engineer, QA]<br>GuyBrush[Software Engineer, Public Relations]<br>ParryDox[Graphic Design]<br>Laughing Luna[QA]<br>XtremeEnigma[Eng-Ops, Security]<br>Ragna[Scriptor]<br>Mele(DarkMagicianGirl)[Product Owner, Eng-Ops]<br><br><br>Special Thanks and considerations to the DevPro team, The OCGSoft Team, and FH Teams for helping Salvation setup initially and providing contiuned support to the systems core.

Seriously, we need more C++/C# programmers on our staff! I hope to report good news regarding this by tonight or tomorrow. However, we did finally fix Replays without needing to use the Replay_Viewer.exe file from the folder! DirectX was also brought back, which should help improve FPS performance for some users. There however may be some people with certain graphic drivers (particularly old AMD ones) that will have issues related to crashes during the Side Deck procedure. I've also experienced this issue but found a solution, so please contact me if you also need a fix for this.<br /><br />10/25 Update: Both Clash of the Dracorivals and Ariadne the Absolver have been added!</p>",

Be sure to check it out so that you can save yourselves some time!<br /><br />We've also updated some overdue card IDs, so you may notice some of your decks suddenly missing cards. To remedy this, click the Settings tab and click Open YGOPro folder. Next, right click the file called 'deckfix.bat' AND RUN IT AS ADMINISTRATOR. I REPEAT, IF YOU DON'T RUN IT AS ADMINISTRATOR, YOUR DECKS MAY BE DELETED. After the program finishes, your decks should all be working fine afterward.

However, there's also the chance that this issue may remain unresolved until we reach the browser platform, which may take as long as two months to accomplish.

If you can not see the gamelist, please clear your cache if you are familiar with the method, and if not, just restart the launcher a few times. To explain what happened, we are adding a new deck edit system to the launcher with enhancements over the previous built in version, and it requires a JSON version of the database. The platform we use uses a variant of Node.js called iojs2.3.0, which was upgraded to iojs3.0.0. This resulted in an instablity in the main communication system between the server, the launcher and other internal mechanics server side. Additonally, we where required to install Python2 to the server in order to create the database conversion system. This resulted in our update system going on the frits and freezing, and it has been removed. Additionally, we removed SSL protection to cut down on some other lockup, and removed our OCG mode update system from automated mode until we can address some other failings in the system. All in all, a very unexpectedly botched update.<br /><br />New Cards:<br /><br />Hidden Shot<br />PSYFrame Circut<br />Goyo Chaser<br /><br />Special thanks to Oneshot and YGOhack for coding them, and to StormWolf for testing, as well as Vyro for other database fixes. Special thanks to Chibi, WestcoastKiwi and Irate for working on the deck editor. It should be reaching completion soon. New languages have been added by WestcoastKiwi and Vyro. Additionally, the ranking system is coming online soon, stay tuned!",

Anyways, to what's important: Highspeed Riders, Dimension of Chaos, Dragons of Legend and a few other packs had their card ID's changed, so they are gone from your decks as was warned. You'll have to rebuild them. Most replays will not work anymore, as the update included changes to a lot more stuff. Finally, you may see the file update counter to be in the high thousands, you don't have to wait for all of this, once it's downloading .lua files it is safe to play. If you have an 'Invalid Deck' problem when trying to play, make sure your databses are fully updated. (go to settings, open YGOPro folder, databases, delete all in there files and restart client) Again, we're sorry if the game is a bit unstable today, we'll be doing our best to fix everything.

First off, you may have noticed we finally integrated everybody's chat account with their duelserver/forum account. This provides a greater degree of security, as well as allowing for easier access. Coming along with this is some unfortunate news, in that accounts with spaces in them are not valid in chat, due a bug we cannot fix. Your name will be cut off at the space. Next up, Reach has created a new background and skin to use in preparation for his upcoming tournament, which you can find more information about on the forums. Next up, we have pushed patches to both Newgioh and Goat Format, so both of those should now be working properly! Lastly, you may have notice something AccessDenied and I have been working on and implemented yesterday. Salvation's interface is now offered in Spanish, Portuguese, German, Dutch and French! Italian and Turkish support will be following soon. We will soon make a forum post about how YOU can get invovled with translation, and make Salvation Development's development avalible in your own language as well. You can select your language of choice by clicking the name of your language in violet on the home screen. Credit for the current translations is as follows:<br /><br />Spanish: Chibi<br /><br />Portuguese: Adriano<br /><br />German: Irate<br /><br />Dutch: Sylveraine<br /><br />French: Tsundere<br /><br />So big thanks to all of them, and make sure to enjoy all the new things Salvation has to offer!</p>",

If you find a fundemental system is missing or something to that effect let us know. Additionally in a unrelated matter, the server has been tanking a number of DDOS attacks. We are unsure why we are being attacked or if it is specifically our system that is being attacked and not our server neighbors but if you are attacking please contact AccessDenied so we can have talks about the issue that is so conserning you feel the need to attack our servers. Nothing is being accomplished by the terrosim, it is not interupting gameplay only sending the staff annoying emails every few hours.<br /><br /> During the server update I understood that most duelist would be huttled over at DevPro, I kept an eye on matters and communicated the server status to them. On completion of the update I added the above cards and notified the users there. Unfortunately this was right in the middle of DevPro staff explaining why it had not updated its system with the above cards. I was banned for 'promoting another ygo sim'. This seems to be common law within us YGOSims now. I am unsure how things will develop. Salvation is now clearly a threat to the other simulators and I thank the users here for our success in becoming relavant. I do not see peaceful times ahead being business-like to gain users staff and fund our servers each YGOSim must behave in a self protecting way that makes co-operation difficult. <br /><br />Each sim is formed out a selfish need of each founder, and due to that we can not see eye to eye. We each have needs and we each respect each others needs and rights to satify those needs.I simply ask that users not get involved in the fighting.</p>",

Rival Rebounder<br /><br />This update is rather massive; It is us remerging code with FH, the creator of YGOPro, which is the main line of code changes for the client, which is based out of China. ADS, Salvation, DevPro, Percival18, MyCard, TDOANE, and other YGOPro variants not mentioned, cannot maintain their own codebases on our own, and some collaboration is needed to ensure the survival of each other. Flurohydride maintains a DN-like policy for card creation, his team waits till there is a 8-digit card pin to create the FILENAME of the card and then program against. Percival18, DevPro, and Salvation circumvient this by using groupings of unused closely cluster or 9-digit card pins. They eventually have to be removed and/or recycled as the actual filename of the card in the system is added. I am unsure why the policy is this way but the 'edge' sims disagree with it per our userbases urging.<br /><br />The majority of YGOHacks' programming over the past 3 months has been removed from the system to be inline with the merge. We do not do this lightly and it is of no fault of YGOHack. We have no choice. FH owns the development and if we are to have overall updates, card fixes new features, and standard development we have to have a shared code base. If we did not do this the system would overall degrade to be unusuable over the course of about 1yr. With updates like this expect to see the same behavior from the other YGOPro variants. The edge code will be removed in favor of the mainline.<br /><br />So what can we do about this? Communicate with FH, VanillaSalt, DailyShana, Salix5, and others. DevPro occationally lands patches into mainline but it all has to do with communication and planning. I urge the community to rally around YGOHack137, ChibiChanNyan, and Oneshot as they try to land patches into the mainline and get the credit they deserve for thier efforts. This is an intimidating order, there are language barriers and ideological barriers. <br /><br />If you have filed a card bug recently please check to see if it still exists and let us know if it was solved or a new issue created. Please support and be patient with us as we blaze forth on the edge!</p>",

            "Subtitle": "A History Lesson",
            "Content": "<p>Last spring/summer I called a summit and invited all the owners of simulators and talked about how to better the community, around the time Pendulum monsters where announced. DuelingNetwork(DN), MyCard[YGOPro China], DevPro[YGOProGermany], Salvation[YGOPro America], Percival, The Dawn of a New Era(TDOANE tah-doun-[eh with a canadian accent])[YGOPro Canada], MackPro, Xerocreative, Checkmate[YGOPro Italy] and the newly formed YGOrganization where all invited. DN, Dev, Salv, Mack, XC, Checkmate and the wikia representing YGOrg attended. MyCard phoned it in due to China's firewall blocking Skype. After meeting we came away with this.<br /><br />DN and the YGOPros would work out a common DB for updating both systems quickly<br />DN opensouced its GUI Protocols.<br />The Major Pros would build an opensource sever side system.<br />Implementation for Pendulum summoning on all the systems<br />Salvation would distribute YVD<br />We would have common bans for specific problem users, people that do things like DDoS.<br /><br />So a lot of good stuff. BlackLusterSolider(Owner/Creator of DN) for the most part is a cool guy. Most people are scared of him or don't like him based on his staff but he himself I promise you is a very cool dude. I don't for the life of me understand why he employs such scummy guys as his higher staff. DevPro created a way to edit its db's but you had to be a dev on its systems which really made no sense. DN defense system banned Checkmates statistics bot. Salvation-DevPro built the server side system called YGOCore via Buttys. Pendulum summoning is obviously out, we shared ideas on how to handle it. I never got that copy of YVD to distribute but MykeZero was cool to talk with and always has been, he is sort of my hero. All the YGOPro have technology specific forknukes (Google forkbomb) pointed at each other so they are all behaving. If I had to guess DN's recent attacks are due to a salty guy getting rejected in this hiring round. Salvation and DevPro are sharing staff but then this happened.<br /><br />One of the owners and a shared staff got mad at each other because the DevPro owner would CONSTANTLY overwrite his code with bugged code from the FH-YGOPro github (orginial YGOPro) then call him useless then the staff member said some racist hardheaded stuff. DN and the YGOPros agreed to create a common DB system so YGOPro DevPro and Salvation could update and the INFORMATION be controlled by the YGOrganization.<br /><br />The YGorg seemed to be ok with this until they found out that the YGOPros each have propriety servers for the game. They DEMANDED that the source code for the ygopro's be made 100% opensouce before they would help in anyway. The representative from the YGOrganization was the owner of the wikia. I had suggested scrapping the wikia like some phone apps do to get a data load that the COMMUNITY would maintain for the sims via the wikia. The scrap isnt even necessary the admin at just has to create a backup which he should be doing anyway, on a monthly or bi-weekly basis. Checkmate(Owner of Checkmate) made the code to create the database dumps for the YGOPros and was awaiting the DB definitions from DN. Never got them. The SQL would allow all the sims, DN included to be translated accurately into a multitude of languages including Spanish, French and German!<br /><br />SO.... I've tried to unite the community into DevPro and DN under the YGOrganization as an information source and failed multiple times due to cockblocking by the YGOrganization if it wasnt debunking the idiotic lies they tell each other, dealing with GPL vs MIT ideologies, or anarchism it's just salt about the fact automation replaces the rule of the DN Judge reign.<br /><br />So Salvations source code is 100% available for view on Github, you are not allowed to make a spin-off version of it but there are provisions that provide you with everything you could possibly want to create your own YGOPro. All of it documented. Now after the recent incident on DevPro and its later and later updates version control issues people getting sick and Salvation's dedication to creating nostalgic formats we have released two new repos :<br /><br />https://github.com/SalvationDevelopment/YGOPro-Database screw the wikia, we are building out our own database the public can update, unaffliated updaters and contributers can edit our database if they find errors or ADD NEW CARDS. Same with the scripts https://github.com/SalvationDevelopment/Salvation-Scripts If you want to be an admin with us just start adding code.<br /><br />And I DARE YGOrganization members to contribute because I bet they won't because they are salt and sucking on DN's jugular vein like cancer cells. No one cares about LightPulsar, or renames, people just want the cards. The database is open to DevPro Checkmate Percy and TDOANE also.<br /><br />My goal is for the community to heal from the insane elitism and meglomania over the last decade that have crushed this game. I'm giving people that know how things are suppose to work access to a way to change rulings and card text. Those scripts and text get compiled down to our server nightly or on demand.<br />I challenge the community that thinks itself appropriate to judge this game to do more than to study a handbook, and take an online test get a call and say your word is law over the masses. I challenge them to prove they have the merit to the position the same way the coders of Unix, Linux, Mozilla, Chrome, OpenOffice, and the whole of the basis for the internet, and science community have. With public peer review and dedication. I want the community to see who just wants power to kick and ban and who really wants to help. I want to post a list of names for all to see in this update feed.<br /><br />YGOrg had 2 jobs, 2 jobs to help the community in 'ending misinformation' report the news and press,... an save button,... once,... a month.<br /><br />That github also houses a lot of other sims stuff including 2 versions of DN's possibly new interface that if you want to contribute to making DN PLAYABLE ON MOBILE you can contribute to too. After the American team left DevPro I was thinking we could do the most good by helping DN and giving it developers. The process of just getting an understanding of what the community wanted and needed from DN was painful. The administration went so far as to delete a whole subforum so we would not have access to the information we needed to make the changes. Even after we got BLS's seal of approval. He would not remove his staff or force them to work with us so we just gave up. DN if you want mobile start acting like it and publically writing code and getting members to start posting bounties on features and fixes. DN is being choked, and sucked on by its own administration and its users are so tramatized from being abused and ignored if someone rises up to help the WHOLE community attacks that person for being so bold. This community has so few developers and it needs many more. DN has 3 Developers. BLS, a close frined of his to make tiny refindments, and NeoArk who can only edit the database. And then 50-80 judges, forum admins, and moderators. DevPro has 10 devs and about 10 mods, TDOANE 2 and 10 mods, Salvation 10 devs and 10 Mods, Percy 4 devs 2 mods, MyCard, 25 devs 10 mods.</p>",

            "Title": "What's the difference between YGOPro Devpro and The YGOPro Salvation Server?",
            "Subtitle": "A History Lesson",
            "Content": "<p>DevPro had internal management issues that ultimately I could not resolve. Basically discrimination and insubordination, it suffered a staff coup like its original birth from TDOANE. It happened in stages and left Benblub singularly in charge. Instead of the majority of the staff having access to the server its been cut down to I would guess max 3 people. Updates seem to be done via FTP and then Ben or Sid manually switches the new updates on. However he has that server configured its security is incompatible (and always has been) with the way DevPro is built. That is why it crashes and stays off for so long.<br /><br />This is different from Checkmate, Percy and DN where they go offline due to network load or attacks.<br /><br />DevPro has 3 programs that run on the server they are proprietary. A central chat-gamelist-login server, and a core generator and game manager. Finally a ygocore or ygopro game instance with no GUI.<br /><br />The first two programs are points of failure. The ygocores can error out and confuse the game manager. This causes it to stop producing cores because it spins up 200-500 at a time and manages them recycling them as needed. If the core errors out due to the security settings on the server the core does not return to the pool until reviewed. This is fine and great for finding card bugs but doesnt work when no one is watching the server. They update it and go to bed, Salvation updates if cards cause bugs they dont lock the server and everyone working on the project has a decent degree of server access to prevent issues.<br /><br />When it locks up you get the [server is full] bug. When the server restarts or the central program errors it cause the server to reject login. The system isn't configured to restart the process. If a manager goes offline same issue no hosting. Some one has to manually go into the server and restart it. (of few have access)<br /><br /><strong>To push an update out on Devpro all the files have to be gathered and the version of DevPro upticked. This setup encourages waiting and waiting to update.</strong> Salvation uses a non-versioning system and individually checks all 20,000 files in an installation and verifies that you have them and they are within a certain error range, updated. The update runs every 120 seconds. So all we ever do is upload changes via git or Dropbox.<br /><br />On Salvation there are 3 programs. A IRC server, a central server, and an opensourced customized version of YGOCore. The central server will file a error report if it crashes and restart itself. It also starts up 4 instances of itself that act as core managers and from there starts ygocore with variable configurations. DevPro is locked to 1 (OCG-with tcg rulings on specific cards) Salvation can make more accurate rulings. The IRC is separate incredibly stable unlike DevPro's custom option and highly documented. We are able to leverage everything that touches IRC due to that included more bots than just [Dev]DevBot, we where able to recreate all of DevPro's customizations also.<br /><br />IRC solves the social issues DN has and some of the ones on DevPro. I intended for DevPro to use IRC but Buttys just built a new chat server it's now the main cause of DevPros lag. Each user can create their own rooms/teams/clans ad-hoc and at no cost. They set the political climate of those rooms. People that don't want to be near each other don't have to be. You dont even need to install the launcher to access these room. You can have your team on Salvation and play on DN/YGOPro/DevPro.<br /><br />DevPro uses IIS, Salvation uses nginx-apache, DN uses Apache-TomCat, draw your own conclusions if you know what that stuff is.<br /><br /. DevPro is written in C# and PHP, Salvation is written in HTML CSS JavaScript, and now GO. So I can leverage more programmers. Salvation <strong>is</strong>a website. Its launcher is just a stripped-down browser with a few special features. It just pulls down http://ygopro.us and responses to http request you make to yourself with the launcher acting as a server that maintains and launches YGOPro. You will notice that increasingly more features will be web accessible. DevPro has this but it's not translated well to the interface. Also interface. Look boobies!<br /><br />No devpoint system or anything like it will ever be implemented because it causes people to get upset and abuse the staff. The only pay system we implementing is one that will put bounties on bugs and features the developers here can not fix or implement with thier own skill sets. The system has a refund system also. Someone could file a bug/feature request lobby american congress style and have a rogue coder show up and implement it.<br /><br />DevPro has a policy that stems from god knows where that is basically anarchism. Abusive users may complain on the staff and this usually results in the staff member being removed. So they have increasing dwindling staff like DN. The staff there is scared to act, and to make matters worst all the security I wrote to track user issues was removed. A user pretty much can't be banned and if they are they can very successfully seek revenge. Not that it matters; you have to be VERY highly ranked to even ban, and even then it's a ban that can't be enforced because of mismanagement how to remove it got out. Topped with a 'no more than 1 hour' policy making it pointless. I'm pretty sure all the admin actions are logged and will result in review if used. At just a handful it's less than or equal to DN's high ranked staff that can even ban for that sad 1 hour. The devpoint system doesnt help much giving the primarily American audience the mentality the volunteers are staff and can complain on them like retail workers. So like DN did to YVD DevPro is slowly turning it once peaceful community into hateful-cancer plaguespreaders.<br /><br />The basic premise is I had a vision for how I wanted YGOPro to work and I took that vision to TDOANE found that I couldnt implement it and left with the people that could help me do that. As they took my engineering ideas because engineering is not programming it's a seperate skill they started ignoring my design plans and doing as they pleased and slowly locking me out of engineering and programming via language choice and security access.<br /><br />Salvation is a bit of a revenge project in I am proving that I was right in my designs and how people should be treated. Of the DevPro devs I'm pretty low on programmer skill, but you can see by the way Salvation is built I have the broadest outlook. The system is VERY far behind the other simulators, TDOANE has far more features, and DevPro vastly more.<br /><br />Revenge for the way my staff was treated. I mean no harm to DevPro but I know how it is ran how it is built and I know it will rot. As far as the management and assiting of keeping YGOPro/DN as a whole up to date we will help DN DevPro Percy and MyCard, but I have my goals. And they are pretty devious. They require going all out for the salvation of the YuGiOh community. I grew up on XC-YVD and DN basically killed the place not from abandonment but by taking the worst elements of YVD and institutionalizing them then killing YVD's culture. I want to get back at basically everyone that has abused the community by turning a blind eye while in administrative power by automating their jobs.<br /><br />If you want a reason for using Salvation over DevPro, Salvation is going somewhere, updates faster, has a nicer community and is more stable. Our staff is kind and open-hearted if not harsh at times. As great as DevPro is I was very stifled in the way I drew up some of the designs so Salvation is my opporitunity to prove I was right and so far it seems I have been.<p/>",

You'll immediately see the effect in your deck editor. Keep in mind many of these cards were made in a hurry and are likely to contain <strong>many</strong> bugs! We depend on you lovely users testing to be able to find them all. We will be opening a bug report thread right after this so let us know if anything isn't functioning correctly.</p><p> Above all, have fun and enjoy this new feature of the Salvation YGOPro Server!
